Also, limit the use of redundant connectives and fillers like ‘moreover,’ ‘furthermore,’ ‘additionally,’ ‘however,’ ‘therefore,’ ‘consequently,’ ‘importantly,’ ‘notably,’ ‘as well as,’ ‘despite,’ ‘essentially,’ and avoid starting sentences with phrases like ‘Firstly,’ ‘Moreover,’ ‘In today’s digital era,’ ‘In the world of’. Focus on delivering the information in a concise and natural tone without unnecessary embellishments, jargon, or redundant phrases. Sound like a human."
